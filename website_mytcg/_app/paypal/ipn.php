// TODO: This component is at a critical stage. It can go anywhere  from this point forward.
//       Find out exactly what needs to be done, what the use cases are. If anything is not as 
//       it should be, it could be tidious to update this component.
//
//           Use Case 1:
//           - All transaction activity is logged in a table. This includes Succesfull transfers,
//             refunds, failures, pending statusses etc.
//           - We still need a way to identify the user via IPN. It can be done via normal postbacks,
//             but seeing as the frontend is purely clientside, it could mess around with the normal
//             system processes
//           - Setup notification emails

Completed: The payment has been completed, and the funds have been added successfully to your account balance.

Created: A German ELV payment is made using Express Checkout.

Expired: This authorization has expired and cannot be captured.

Failed: The payment has failed. This happens only if the payment was made from your customerâ€™s bank account.

Pending: The payment is pending. See pending_reason for more information.

Refunded: You refunded the payment.

Reversed: A payment was reversed due to a chargeback or other type of reversal. The funds have been removed from your account balance and returned to the buyer. The reason for the reversal is specified in the ReasonCode element.
